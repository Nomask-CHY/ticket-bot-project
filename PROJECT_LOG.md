## 1. Project Goal
To build a ticket-buying bot using Python and Selenium, while practicing Git for version control.

## 2. Development Plan

*   **Phase 1: Project Initialization & Environment Setup (COMPLETED)**
    *   [x] Create GitHub repository.
    *   [x] Clone repository locally.
    *   [x] Create Python virtual environment (`venv`).
    *   [x] Install `selenium` and `webdriver-manager`.
    *   [x] Create `.gitignore` file.

*   **Phase 2: Core Function Development (IN PROGRESS)**
    *   [x] Write basic script `main.py`.
    *   [x] Import necessary libraries.
    *   [x] Setup and start the browser driver.
    *   [x] Navigate to a target website.
    *   [x] Handle login.
    *   [ ] Implement ticket-grabbing logic.

*   **Phase 3: Code Optimization & Version Control**
    *   [ ] Move credentials to a config file.
    *   [ ] Use Git (`add`, `commit`, `push`, `branch`) to manage progress.

## 3. Current Status & Next Step

*   **Last Session Date:** 2025年7月2日
*   **Current File:** `main.py`
*   **Progress:** The user has successfully set up the browser, navigated to Google, and added placeholder comments for the login functionality.
*   **NEXT STEP:** Guide the user to implement the actual login functionality. This will involve identifying login elements (username, password fields, login button) and using Selenium to interact with them.
